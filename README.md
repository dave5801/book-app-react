# book-app-react

This application is my attempt to learn basic React. It is a simple book store. A user may select from a list of book and add to a shopping cart, then remove from a shopping cart. Thus far, I'm learning a lot about states and components. CSS is minimal and List of available books is hardcoded at the moment, the goal would be to integrate the Google Books API. 

(Also, no test cases at the moment, sorry)

# Run the app:

open command line terminal

make a new directory

clone the repo

navigate to the 'book-ap' directory

run: "npm start"
